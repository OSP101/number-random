# Random Name with Fix Result using React Spring

## **Motivation**

Have you ever been to a party and wanted to add an element of surprise to selecting participants for a game or event? The [Wheelofnames](https://wheelofnames.com/) website is great for randomizing names, but it lacks the ability to fix the result for announcing participants. For instance, in the case of a birthday surprise where you already know who the birthday person is, having a fixed result can make the party much more fun. This open-source project addresses that need.

## **Overview**

This project allows you to randomize a list of names while ensuring that a specific set of names always appears in the result. It's perfect for situations where you want an element of surprise but need to guarantee the presence of certain individuals.

The fixed names in the example code in **`src/data.ts`** include `'Payton', 'Jedediah', 'Gerson', 'Betsy', and 'Shanel'`.

## **Stack**

- [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/): A powerful animation library for React.
- React + Vite + TypeScript: The foundation of this project.
- [tsparticles](https://particles.js.org/) + [confetti](https://confetti.js.org/): Adding particle animations for a festive touch.

## **Getting Started**

To use this project, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Customize the list of fixed names in **`src/data.ts`** to fit your needs.
4. Start the development server and have fun with your fixed-result randomizer!

## **Original Project**

This project was inspired by the [React Spring Example](https://www.react-spring.dev/examples) from the [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/cisbc). We built upon this foundation to create a specialized tool for fixed-result randomization.

## **Sound License**

We've included a delightful click sound effect to enhance the user experience. The sound is licensed under the [Mixkit License](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/click/), and you can find the sound file here:
